Sentiment analysis using VADER in Python of the BC Provincial Election in May 2017

For this analysis, I used the Python package VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner) which is a “lexicon and rule-based sentiment analysis tool that is specifically attuned to sentiments expressed in social media, and works well on texts from other domains,” as described by its developers. With VADER, there is no need to provide positive and negative text examples to train a classifier on, so analysis is quick and easy.

The VADER github repository can be found here: https://github.com/cjhutto/vaderSentiment.

Note that this was done super fast and the plots are not the prettiest. It's interesting, none the less!
